# EHMTracker

An app that keeps track of player attributes throughout your virtual career as a General Manager in Eastside Hockey Manager.

***Note that this application needs the EHMAssistant application, you cannot use the EHMTracker without the EHMAssistant for the moment.***

## User Guide
First of all, the first use can be difficult because there are a few steps to do. However, once the steps are well understood, it becomes very simple.

### Steps to do in the EHM Assistant
1. Start your game and open the EHMAssistant and click on "Load Game".
2. This step is very important, in the EHMAssistant app, go to the "Options" menu, under the PLAYERS tab, click on "Select All" to select all the fields to show in the PLAYERS tab. If you don't do that, the EHM Tracker won't work as it will be missing some fields.
3. In the PLAYERS tab, click "Filter" and choose the settings you want. The players resulting from the filters are the ones that you will be able to track in the EHM Tracker.
4. Once you are satisfied with the players returned by the filters (you can keep the filters empty to get all the players in the game), select the "CSV" button to export this list as a .csv file.
You can then close the EHMAssistant, you won't need it for the next steps.

### Steps to do in the EHM Tracker

1. In the EHM Tracker, if you don't have a file imported in the application already, it will ask you to import one. Select the .csv file that you just exported from the EHMAssistant.
2. Once the app has imported the file, you will see the list of players imported. You can filter by teams, leagues, and player names.
3. In the Snapshots Management menu, you can add, edit or delete snapshots. A snapshot is a "picture" of the ratings of every player imported in the application at the moment you exported the .csv file from the EHMAssistant.
4. In the players list from the main page, you can click on a player to see his current ratings and the ratings from a snapshot. On this page, you can select any snapshot that you have created and compare the ratings from that snapshot to the player's current ratings.
